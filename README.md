# Bus-Transport-Project
Here is a bus transport project in java, which I made when I was learning java swing. This project is a window based application which can be used to book bus tickets. Although, this projects needs a lot of work to be done, but it can help for someone new to learn swing in java.
The working of the application is that you will see a login page, as we haven't worked with database yet in this application, you need to create an account everytime you
run the program by clicking the 'create account' button and after creating account go back to login page and login with the login credintials created while creating account. And just fill the details when you login to book the bus-ticket.
